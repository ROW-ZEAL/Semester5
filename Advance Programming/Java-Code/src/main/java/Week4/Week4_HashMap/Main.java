// Question:
//    Scenario: Library Catalog Using HashMap
//    You are working on a library catalog system where you
//    need to create a program to manage books using a HashMap
//    data structure in Java. Each book's record should include
//    the book title, author name, and ISBN. You need to implement
//    various operations to add, search, and remove books from the
//    catalog.
